# Yatzhee_AI
This repo holds both a rudimentary version of Yatzhee and my first experimentation in AI learning to play games and optimise decision making

Note this uses TensorFlow, and therefore requires Python 3.11

Inspiration, Inception of idea, presented initial results to work colleagues in a presentation (maybe link presentation? might need to remove branding)
